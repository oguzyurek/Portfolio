      <h2>BIM Voice Assistant</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Digital information loss during the building life cycle, especially
        between the design and construction phases is incontrovertible. Except
        for the BIM experts, other involved people, such as craftsmen or project
        managers, do not have direct access to BIM data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The project’s goal is to introduce a new computer-human interface that
        allows users to access BIM data with minimal training and effort. During
        the design process, a VR/AR project presentation session, or on-site
        construction, there are moments that we reach the limits of a GUI
        (Graphical User Interface) like a monitor, or a NUI (Natural User
        Interface) like a mouse; and interaction with BIM is not imaginable. BIM
        Voice Assistant can play a meaningful role in these moments and open new
        doors to BIM data transition. BIM Voice Assistant intends to present an
        Alexa for BIM!

      <h2>BIM Voice Assistant Possible Scenarios</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        BIM Voice Assistant understands the voice command, extracts data from
        the BIM model, and responds with a voice message. The voice-assistant
        consists of five major modules: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
        Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Generation (NLG),
        Building Information Extraction (BIE), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). The ASR
        module converts the voice query to a text.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The NLP module’s output is the classification of specific keywords
        within the text as its input data. The BIE module extracts corresponding
        data from the building information model, according to the classified
        keywords from the NLP module. The chosen BIM model format in this
        research is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The NLG module uses
        programmed information including keywords from the NLP module and the
        obtained building information data from the BIE module to generate the
        result as a natural language response. Finally, the TTS module converts
        the required response’s text to a voice message.

      <h2>Functionality Diagram</h2>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The robot's movement is simulated and visualized using RVIZ. As the
        gypsum boards are cut, ROS publishes messages regarding the fabrication
        process, including whether the process has not started, started, or
        finished. The resulting panel geometry is subsequently pushed back to
        the server as an IfcBuildingElementProxy, and the panels are labeled
        with their fabrication status.

      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Based on a number of application scenarios, several basic commands have
        been implemented. All stakeholders in the construction industry can
        benefit from a higher bandwidth in human-computer interaction. The Voice
        assistant project started with the aim to create three of the most
        fundamental elements in IFC, ”IFCWall”, ”IFCWindow” and ”IFCDoor” and
        evolved based on the primary outputs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Using the voice assistant, commands for data extraction, editing, and
        adding elements have been the most convenient use cases, respectively.
        It should be noted that regarding adding data to the model (such as a
        new wall), the voice interface has higher efficiency in combination with
        other interfaces (GUI or NUI). Moreover, recognition of the construction
        industry terms has not been always easy for general voice recognition
        engines like google. So, training a specific one seems beneficial.
        Between Sphinx, Google, IBM, Snowboy Hotword Detection, and Microsoft
        Bing, tokenizing the free voice recognition service of google provides a
        proper level of preciseness for scientific purposes.

        A voice assistant for BIM promises higher accessibility to the required
        data during the building life cycle. It can improve the quality and
        efficiency of communication between all stakeholders. BIM Voice
        Assistant has the potential to help architects to add installation
        instructions for craftsmen. It also facilitates the documentation of the
        site inspection data and enables us to extract useful insights from huge
        building models while using other interfaces is not possible. An
        integrated smartphone application with different authority levels, such
        as data entry capabilities for architects, basic data extraction
        capabilities for craftsmen, and data extraction and task assignment for
        project managers, could be the next step of the project. Also,
        conventional BIM software packages could benefit from a voice assistant
        plugin.
